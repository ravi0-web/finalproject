                    Rob Walterâ€™s dedication as South Africa's cricket coach shines through his early starts to watch
                    games live from New Zealand. Balancing player development, franchise commitments, and results,
                    he faces tough decisions and criticism. Despite inconsistent performances, Walter prioritizes
                    long-term growth, fostering competition and preparing the squad for major tournaments.

                    Indian captain Rohit Sharma will join Mumbai's Ranji Trophy practice at Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday.
                    Preparing for the Champions Trophy, he resumed training at MCA-BKC. While practicing with the team,
                    his participation in the game against Jammu & Kashmir remains undecided. Sharma last played Ranji in
                    2015 against Uttar Pradesh.
